# Electronic Health Records.

The advent of real-time tools and data access through the development of the **Internet of Things (IoT)** has revolutionized medical science, enabling the management of electronic health records (EHRs) 
and electronic medical records (EMRs). 
These datasets comprise a wealth of actual laboratory data, encompassing both phenotypic and non-phenotypic information related to disease progression 
(including demographics, patient habits, biomarkers, medical history, medications, laboratory test results and diagnoses).

It's important to distinguish EHRs from EMRs; EHRs are easily shareable across different healthcare organizations such as hospitals, pharmacies, and research laboratories, 
thus opening up a multitude of possibilities. The primary objectives of utilizing EHRs include disease progression research, risk factor prediction, identification of adverse effects, 
disease classification, phenotyping (analyzing and predicting how genetic profiles and environmental factors influence observable traits) and patient cohort analysis.

EHR data mining can be facilitated through various means, including portable sensors and mobile applications, health data from insurance companies, biomedical images such as 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans, which use magnetic fields, radio waves, and X-rays to generate images, respectively, as well as through genomics research. 
The advantage of EHRs lies in their relative lack of bias compared to data from traditional clinical trials, which often involve strict inclusion and exclusion criteria (longitudinal data). 
Another distinctive aspect of EHRs is their multimodal nature, which authentically represents the diverse challenges patients face. However, managing data with multiple variables for each patient 
(multivariate) can result in numerous levels, leading to a situation where each patient category may have indicators for different diseases and experimental research outcomes (multi-level data). 
Consequently, integrating data from various approaches for each level of each patient's variables into a unified machine learning model becomes complex.

A potential solution could involve applying a standardized method across different levels of each patient's data to harmonize the diverse approaches.
Alternatively, one could consider implementing a sampling technique at regular intervals for patients whose variable interventions are entirely representative and independent of other factors.
