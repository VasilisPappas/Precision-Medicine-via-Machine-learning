It was found that the **Random Forest** exhibited the highest predictive power. Additionally, when the OVO (One-Versus-One) and OVR (One-Versus-Rest) techniques were applied, 
it was observed that their performance was inferior compared to the native Multiclass method embedded within each of the five trained classifiers. 
The methodologies of LIME and SHAP proved valuable in obtaining both local interpretations for individual observations and global interpretations that visualize the most significant variables for all observations.

Future considerations for optimizing strategies could involve **increasing the sample size** by including more participants, enriching surveys with additional Electronic Health Record (EHR) data 
and exploring the application of different machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. With the collaboration of medical professionals and the support of technology, 
the field of medicine can improve diagnostic accuracy and provide more timely, accurate and personalized treatments.

Currently, I am awaiting a larger sample of patients to assess whether **learning curves** indicate that the sample size is adequate and whether accuracy or other metrics show improvement. 

*The results from SHAP and LIME explanations will be included in the final project report.*
