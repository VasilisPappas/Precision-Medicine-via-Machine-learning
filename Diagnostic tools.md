# Neuropsychiatric indicators

This category includes entries (questions) described by the tools of **NPI** (Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Psychiatric Symptom Inventory Questionnaire) and
**GDS** (Geriatric Depression Scale).

**NPI**: *comprises 12 questions, each divided into two components: symptom severity (S) and symptom frequency (F). 
Frequency is evaluated on a scale of 0 to 4, while severity (indicating the level of patient discomfort due to the symptom) is rated from 0 to 3. 
Elevated values for these indicators denote higher frequency and discomfort levels.*

**GDS**: *consists of 15 questions, each offering YES/NO response options. A value of 0 or 1 is assigned to each question based on whether the answer aligns positively or negatively 
with the patient's psychological state. Responses favoring the respondent's positive psychological state are given a value of 0, while those reflecting negativity are assigned 1. 
It's important to highlight that the test's design suggests a potential emotional disorder if the total score of answers exceeds 5. 
Consequently, questions with negatively oriented answers contribute to the final score.*

# Neurocognitive indicators

We distinguish two tools here as well: the neurocognitive estimations of **MOCA** (MOntreal Cognitive Assessment) and **COGTEL** (Cognitive Telephone Screening Instrument).

**MOCA**: *encompasses 10 codes aimed at appraising the patient's overall cognitive capacity. This assessment explores cognitive domains such as memory, 
visuospatial skills, abstract reasoning, attention and more. 
Notably, it has the capability to identify Mild Cognitive Impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease and can also detect other pathologies in individuals with cognitive impairments.*



**COGTEL**: *It serves as a precise measure, capable of distinguishing between individuals spanning the entire spectrum of adult cognitive performance. 
Its value extends beyond merely detecting cognitive deficits, as it also highlights inter-individual variances, even when cognitive function falls within the range of healthy performance. 
Specifically, it evaluates 7 cognitive domains.*


### Higher values of MOCA and COGTEL variables correspond to better average cognitive ability among the patients. In contrast, elevated values of the neuropsychiatric indices GDS and NPI signify potential indicators of psychiatric disorders that could also be linked to the presence of pre-dementia or dementia syndromes.
